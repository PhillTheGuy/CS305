Artemius financial is a financial compenay in which they are given money by the customers give them money and they are tasked to do insurance of money investments and retiremet. The client wanted us to address how they should incress the security of their code. The importance of codeing securely means that you are protecting both the consumers and the company by for example protecting the money and not getting it transfered to an account it should not be. the part that is most challange for me is manually reviewing code as my dyslexia can very easly get me confused. the way i increased security was by adding AES-128 encryption and SHA-256 hashing togeather. the best tools for codeing in my opinion are visual studio and eclipes. i belive this would show that i can do AES encryptions and gennerate .cer files.
